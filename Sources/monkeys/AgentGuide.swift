monkeys for an automated caller

A stored secret must never enter an agent's context or transcript. Anything
an agent reads stays in both, and a vault cannot take it back. No command
prints a stored secret, so the only thing to get right is how one is spent.

monkeys run puts the named secrets into one command's environment, and
nowhere else:

  monkeys run OPENROUTER_API_KEY ./hello.sh
  monkeys run OPENROUTER_API_KEY,GITHUB_TOKEN ./deploy

Nothing on that line holds a secret, so nothing an agent writes can spill
one. The exit status and the signals are the command's own. Its output comes
back through monkeys, and a stored secret in it comes back as [redacted KEY],
so echo $KEY says which secret was there and never the secret. --no-redact is
for a human writing a secret into a file on purpose; an agent does not add
it.

A project that has a .monkeys file has already listed the keys it needs, and
run there takes only the command:

  monkeys run ./hello.sh

A + line names the namespace the profiles live in, the @ lines scope every
key, and the first profile in the file is the one run uses unless @profile
says otherwise, so set in that directory stores into the same profile the
command reads from. The file is the list; read it before adding a key.
Filling a profile from a shared .monsecrets bundle is monkeys unpack, which
asks for a passphrase, so that too is a human's job.

Name the keys the command actually reads. Naming them is how a missing secret
shows up, and it keeps the rest out of a process that has no business with
them. --all spends everything, for when the keys are not worth working out:

  monkeys run --all ./hello.sh

A key with no secret stored stops the run before it starts, and says what to
ask for:

  monkeys: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not stored yet
  nothing ran. a human has to store it, then try again:
    monkeys set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

An agent passes that on. Storing a secret is a human's job: an agent that
types one puts it in its own context before it reaches the vault.

To see what exists, read the keys with monkeys list, and their secrets' shape
with monkeys preview:

  $ monkeys preview
  GITHUB_TOKEN        gh...f 40
  OPENROUTER_API_KEY  sk...2 73

\(maskingRule)

A length and a two-character prefix confirm that the right secret arrived
without reading it.

monkeys export writes vault lookups for a startup file and holds no secret,
which is why it may print. A variable that already holds a secret is never
printed. Each of these puts a secret in front of whoever ran it:

  echo "$OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
  env
  printenv

So does writing one into a file, a log, a commit, or a bug report. Where a
config file wants the secret, write whatever reference its format offers, such
as ${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}, and let the program expand it.
